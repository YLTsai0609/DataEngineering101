# Data Goverance

Data governance is the process of **organizing, securing, managing, and presenting data using methods and technologies that ensure it remains correct, consistent, and accessible to verfied users.**

Organizing - identifying your data sources and getting all your data in one place.

Securing - make sure all your data is compliant with data privacy regulations.

Managing and presenting data - after you’ve nailed down your organization’s data, you need to decide how you present this data to your team.
