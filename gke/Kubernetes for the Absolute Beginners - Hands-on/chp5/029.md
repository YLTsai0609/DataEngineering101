# Deployment

forget about pods and replicaset

when you developing - there might be rolling update. and failure restarted

1. pods contain the application of your developement (multiple container with shared network)
2. replica make sure the scaling
3. Deployment is a kubernates object to submit it all in once. (rolling update, undo changes, parse and resume changes)

# Commands

`kubectl get all` (get all kubernates objects)

# 030

1. `kubectl apply -f 030_deployment.yaml`
2. `kubectl get all`
3. `kubectl describe deployments myapp-deployment`

1. trouble shooting 

`kubectl get all` --> `kubectl get deployment` --> `kubectl get replicaset (rs)` --> `kubectl get pods` --> `kubectl describe pod pod-id` (to check the image error then)

2. `kubectl create deployment --help` : get help information about deployment

3. `kubectl apply deployment --help` 
4. when updating

```
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment
