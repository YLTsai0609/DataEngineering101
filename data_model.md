# Data Modeling

Dimension : Dimensional Modeling (DM) is a data structure technique optimized for data storage in a Data warehouse. The purpose of dimensional modeling is to optimize the database for faster retrieval of data. The concept of Dimensional Modelling was developed by Ralph Kimball and consists of “fact” and “dimension” tables.

* ususally grow slow, small enough compare with fact table

Facts : Facts are the measurements/metrics or facts from your business process. For a Sales business process, a measurement would be quarterly sales number

* ususally immutable
* ususally grow fast (event-like)
